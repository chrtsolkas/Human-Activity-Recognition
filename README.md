# Human Activity Recognition Dataset
This is the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

In our analysis we use the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The script run_analysis.R contains detailed comments of the applied processing on the data sets.

The codebook was generated with the [dataMaid package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataMaid/index.html)  with small modifications afterwards.
