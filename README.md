# Human-Activity-Recognition
This is the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. We use the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
